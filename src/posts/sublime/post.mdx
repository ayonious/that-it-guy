import { CodeDivWrapper } from "../../css/commonstyles";
import Highlight from "react-highlight.js";

An amazing light weight Editor. Must to have. I se it for all kind of string related operations on any set of data. Lets checkout how we can set it up like a pro

## Installation

Just google sublime text. Download the installer for mac click on it. its easy and simple

## Open a directory in sublime from command line

This is the first feature I setup after installing Sublime text. Lets test this command and see if the magic can work. First lets goto some folder which you want to open in sublime.

<CodeDivWrapper>

<Highlight>

```bash
/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl .
```

</Highlight>
  
</CodeDivWrapper>

If this command works that means you can copy this in system path and run it as a command. Lets do this

<CodeDivWrapper>

<Highlight>

```bash
cp /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/subl
```

</Highlight>

</CodeDivWrapper>

Now test it:

<CodeDivWrapper>

<Highlight>

```bash
subl .
```

</Highlight>

</CodeDivWrapper>

## Install package control in sublime

All the features that Im going to describe probably most of them will need this as dependency.
You need to install Package Control that will help you install plugins in sublime.
Here is the where you will find instructions to install it https://packagecontrol.io/installation

## Install a plugin using Package Control

Step1: cmd+shift+p

Step2: This will open a list in Sublime. Select this one
`Package Control: install package`

Step3: Now you will get list of all options of plugins. Install the ones that you want.

## Useful shortcuts

```bash
ctrl+P              to find a file
ctrl+f              find string in a file
cmd+shift+f         find string /regex in entire project
cmd + shift + l     if you select multiple lines this will allow
                    to edit all lines at the same time.
