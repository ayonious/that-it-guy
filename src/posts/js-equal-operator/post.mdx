import CodeDivWrapper from "../../components/CodeWrapper";

Whats the difference? The first answer came to my mind was ref equal checking and value checking. That is WRONG. Lets take a look at real difference.

# Double equal operator (not preferred)

<CodeDivWrapper>

```js
0 == "0"; // true
false == 0; //true
undefined == null; // true
```

</CodeDivWrapper>

This performs a complex equalization method. if you are trying to compare string with number it tries to make them same data type and then compare them. For some cases its good.

# Triple equal operator (preferred)

This is exact operator for matching data. if they are of difference types they will never be equal and js don't tries to convert.

<CodeDivWrapper>

```js
0 === "0"; // false
false === 0; //false
undefined === null; // false
```

</CodeDivWrapper>

NOTE: neither == nor === is good enough to compare 2 objects. For comparing 2 objects best way is to write your own function.
