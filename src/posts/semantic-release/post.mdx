Before I started with semantic-release I had to always remember to update the version in package.json and also create a CHANGELOG muyself. But now with semantic-release I was able to automate this all.

# Workflow for Semantic release

After you create and merge a PR. Based on what was in the header of your PR header commit. semantic will do the following:

1.  analyze your commit message.
2.  Create CHANGELOG (optional): Gather all the commit messages(which are not yet pushlished) and create a changelog. (or add new change in current CHAGELOG)
    NOTE: Only way for semantic-release to know which commits are not released is by taking all last commits till a commit tag of format vx.x.x
3.  Create new versionin package.json and package-lock.json: Bump up the version of the package based on your last vx.x.x commit tag in github and you merged PR's header message.
    Example: if you commit message was "feat: somethig" and last git version tag was v1.2.3. Then It will create a new version v1.3.0
4.  Git tag: Create git tag with this new version. Push this tag to github.
5.  Push changes to Git(optional): Changes of 2+3 will be pushed to your github. This part is optional and you can decide which part you want to push.
    I personally dont push the package.json/package-lock.json version update.
6.  Publish to npm
7.  Publish to GitHub Releases with release note (using 2)

# Adding semantic release to your repo

## Step1: install semantic release

<CodeDivWrapper>


```bash
npm install semantic-release --save-dev
```

</CodeDivWrapper>


## Step2: Create last git tag

If you are adding semantic-release to a repo that was already published in npm before, then you need to make sure the last published version is tagged in GitHub. So checkout that commit in GitHub and create a tag there with format vx.x.x and then push it.

This one is needed for semanticc release to know what will be the next version.

## Step3: .releaserc.json file

This file contains order in which all the plugins will work. This is my template

<CodeDivWrapper>


```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/changelog",
    [
      "@semantic-release/git",
      {
        "assets": ["CHANGELOG.md"],
        "message": "chore(release): ${nextRelease.version} [skip ci]\n\n${nextRelease.notes}"
      }
    ],
    "@semantic-release/npm",
    "@semantic-release/github"
  ]
}
```

</CodeDivWrapper>


## Step4: Config Travis

1. create Github token: from https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. create npm token for publishing
3. now put them as secured env variables in your travis config file.

<CodeDivWrapper>


```bash
travis encrypt GH_TOKEN="111......asd" --add
travis encrypt NPM_TOKEN="1e.............ffea" --add
```

</CodeDivWrapper>


4. Now update .travis.yml file like this

<CodeDivWrapper>


```json
deploy:
  provider: script
  edge: true
  cleanup: false
  script:
    - npx semantic-release
  on:
    branch: master
    node_js: '--lts'
env:
  global:
    - secure: ......
    - secure: .....
```

</CodeDivWrapper>
