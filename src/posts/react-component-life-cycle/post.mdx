React's components have a life cycle: Initialization ,update, destroy. During these times you can perform lot of operations that you can't do during the render time. Recently I found some of these situations and wanted to explore all other reacts lifeCycleFunctions.

# Simple React Component Life Cycle

In simple form the life cycle consists of 4 stages:

1. Initialize
2. Mount
3. Update
4. Unmount

then from step4(Unmount) it can go back to step1(Initialize)

# Phase:Initialize

This is when constructor is called and states are created as singleton variables. Props are injected.

# Phase: Mount

When the component is mounted in the DOM

- Event exactly before this phase: componentWillMount()
- Event during this phase: render()
- Event exactly after this phase: componentDidMount()

### NOTE: don't make any data change during componentWillMount.

# Phase: Update

- Event exactly before this phase: componentWillUpdate()
- Event during this phase: render()
- Event exactly after this phase: componentDidUpdate()
- Special: Event exactly before this phase: componentShouldUpdate(): returns a boolean to understand whether the re-rendering will be done.

## Difference between Mount and update

- Mount is called only in the first time.
- Update is called for each sequential render(). This happens usually due to state chagne

# Phase: Unmount

This occurs for example During DOM reconciliation process (this happens during re rendering) if a component does not exist anymore

- Event exactly before this phase: componentWillUnmount()
