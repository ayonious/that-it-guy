If you are new to react you might be starting a new react project using create-react-app. But then you never really get to configure this babel and Webpack. So here Im describing the bare min of babel and Webpack.

# Babel

Official definition is: Babel is a JS compiler. This is something that converts our modern JS to plain ES5 that can run in any browser.

My definition is: We use JSX in react and lots of cool feature of ECMA script. babel ocnverts them in ES5

# Babel code examples

in the file of .babelrc I use this. This actually tells

<CodeDivWrapper>

```bash
{
  "presets": [
    "@babel/preset-env",
    "@babel/preset-typescript",
    "@babel/preset-react"
  ]
}

// if no targets are specified, @babel/preset-env will transform all ECMAScript 2015+ code by default.
// @babel/preset-react is for transforming the react code
// typescript is understandable what it does
// some others are
```

</CodeDivWrapper>

You can configure babel to tell which browser to be this compatible to. or als omention range of versions of browsers.

Here is a pure html code that tells browser that to understand this code part you need babel compiler

<CodeDivWrapper>

```html
<script type="text/babel">
  function Printtr(props) {
    return <h1>{props.input}</h1>;
  }
  var App = <Printtr input="This is app" />;
  ReactDOM.render(App, document.getElementById("root"));
</script>
```

</CodeDivWrapper>

# Webpack

Imagine you write a project in React. Now browsers dont understand react. This react project needs to be converted to pure js and html bundle. And also all those styles-components / scss that you used needs also to be converted to something that your browser understands. Webpack is the tool that will convert this react project into browser understandable bundle.

So after babel has turned the code into ES5 basic js code now its time for Webpack to put all these into the bundle and make it production ready.

# Webpack Usage from Examples

You will see words like `babel-loader`, `html-loader`. These things actually takes those code and puts them into the bundle.

Here are some config part of webpack.

<CodeDivWrapper>

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "test": /\.(js|jsx)$/, //taking all js files created by babel and put it in production bundle
      "exclude": /node_modules/,
      "use": {
        "loader": "babel-loader"
      }
    },
    {
      "test": /\.html$/, //taking also the html file (index.html)
      "use": [
        {
          "loader": "html-loader"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
