Nodejs is a single threaded application (not exactly). So what does it mean? and why is it good?

# Why good

- No need: Deadlock, Race Condition, Starvation, Priority Inversion, LiveLock
- if calls are all asynchronous then nodejs backend applications are considered really fast.
- for sync calls all requests will be queued and thus the response time will be slower.

Lets check this code

<CodeDivWrapper>

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

let data = 1;

app.get("/data", function (req, res) {
  res.send(`${data}`);
});

app.get("/datainc", function (req, res) {
  data++;
  res.send(`data increased`);
});

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log("Example app listening on port 3000!");
});
```

</CodeDivWrapper>

Now goto url

1. `localhost:3000/data` -> "1"
2. `localhost:3000/datainc` -> "data increased"
3. `localhost:3000/data` -> "2"

Note, How easily value of data is shared across api calls. This was possible without thinking about any locks or race conditions.

Now think the same in other languages. Java, C++, dotNet you always have multiple threads and there are some functions that are threadsafe and some that are not thread safe. You always have to think about your service about thread safety of functions.

# Why bad

- Multitasking is not possible which is very important feature in modern languages
