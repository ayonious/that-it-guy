import CodeDivWrapper from "../../components/CodeWrapper/CodeWrapper";

I often see this thing but never understood how it could be used for making life easier. Finally found some good examples and decided to make a summary application of this.

# The sample problem

Imgine you have 3 state variables.
They change based on some button clicks.
All these states are combined to get another text.

## A sample Without reducer

See how you need to initiale each single variable separately. And then write similar kind of function for each one of them

<CodeDivWrapper>

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

import ColorDetails from "../components/ColorDetails";

const CounterScreen = () => {
  const [red, changeRed] = useState(0); // initialize 1
  const [green, changeGreen] = useState(0); // initialize 2
  const [blue, changeBlue] = useState(0); // initialize 3.... ah shit :(

  return (
    <>
      <ColorDetails
        color="Red"
        onDecrease={() => changeRed(red - 15)}
        onIncrease={() => changeRed(red + 15)}
      />
      <ColorDetails
        color="Green"
        onDecrease={() => changeGreen(green - 15)}
        onIncrease={() => changeGreen(green + 15)}
      />
      <ColorDetails
        color="Blue"
        onDecrease={() => changeBlue(blue - 15)}
        onIncrease={() => changeBlue(blue + 15)}
      />
      <span>
        Color is: {state.red} {state.green} {state.blue}
      </span>
    </>
  );
};

export default CounterScreen;
```

</CodeDivWrapper>

## Now with Reducer

See how initialization is now cleaner in one single line. All the calculation of new state object is separated from the component code.

<CodeDivWrapper>

```js
import React, { useReducer } from "react";

import ColorDetails from "../components/ColorDetails";

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  // state = { red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0 }
  // action = { color: 'red', addedVal: 15 }

  const copyState = { ...state };
  copyState[action.color] = copyState[action.color] + action.addedVal;
  return copyState;
};

const CounterScreen = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0 }); // lot cleaner code

  return (
    <>
      <ColorDetails
        color="Red"
        onDecrease={() => dispatch({ color: "red", addedVal: -15 })}
        onIncrease={() => dispatch({ color: "red", addedVal: 15 })}
      />
      <ColorDetails
        color="Green"
        onDecrease={() => dispatch({ color: "green", addedVal: -15 })}
        onIncrease={() => dispatch({ color: "green", addedVal: 15 })}
      />
      <ColorDetails
        color="Blue"
        onDecrease={() => dispatch({ color: "blue", addedVal: -15 })}
        onIncrease={() => dispatch({ color: "blue", addedVal: 15 })}
      />
      <span>
        Color is: {state.red} {state.green} {state.blue}
      </span>
    </>
  );
};

export default CounterScreen;
```

</CodeDivWrapper>
