I have been working with JS related technology for a while now and every now and then I just confuse whether nodejs is a language or not.

I use the term _nodejs_ in the same way as _js_. For example I would say
_Do you know JS?_ and _Do you know nodejs?_ as very similar contexts assuming nodejs to be an advanced js or something like that.

So here Im trying to shortlist all my confusing works so that every now and then I can just remind myself :D

## JS

- Its a language
- All browsers have JavaScript engines that run the JavaScript of web pages

## Nodejs

- A runtime environment of JS. Or a compiler or JS
- Written in (js + c) this compiler can compile JS programs
- Nodejs = (V8 + some libraries)
- is the JS running Engine used by Chrome (V8) additing some other libraries like (io/networking) so that you can do backend stuffs

### So what does it mean when I say I wrote a project in noejs?

Its simply that you created a js project and compiled it using node. For example when do bootstrap a project using npm init its actually running all the compilation/testing using node.

## npm (node package manager)

- managing package of your js project and also by default runs your program with node

## Ecma script

- Its a standard/ set of rules
- Js is an implementation of Ecma script

## Typescript

- programming language developed (by Microsoft)
- it compiles your project into a js project that you can run with node.

# JSX

This is neither a HTML nor a string. This is called JSX.

<CodeDivWrapper>

<Highlight>

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

</Highlight>

</CodeDivWrapper>

- JavaScript XML, an XML-like syntax extension of JavaScript
- ITS NOT A LANGUAGE. (According to nerds on internet)
- Its a suger coating on top of Js. This code will be transpiled to js by babel
- After compilation jsx turns into normal
- This is created by facebook.
- You need babel language definition for the code written in jsx + js to be understandable

<CodeDivWrapper>

<Highlight>

```jsx
<script type="text/babel">
  function Printtr(props) {
    return <h1>{props.input}</h1>
  }
  var App = <Printtr input="This is app" />;
  ReactDOM.render(App, document.getElementById('root'));
</script>
```

</Highlight>

</CodeDivWrapper>

By telling "text/babel" you are saying that babel should transpile this code into pure javascript code.

# Babel

- A language definition.
- This is used to understand code of both ES6 and JSX
- This tranpilies jsx to js

# Webpack

- Converts your react project into ES5 understandable (all browser understandable) code
- Makes a production build of your project.

# CommonJs

- Its a module system for js. it provides a way you can modularize your js.
- There are multiple ways for modularize: commonjs/Ecma
