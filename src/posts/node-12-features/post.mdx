import CodeDivWrapper from "../../components/CodeWrapper";

Since Im exploring newest version features of all languages I thought why not also look at node and see what the heck are they doing in new versions.

As usual I will talk about only the features that I liked most.

# Private class fields

<CodeDivWrapper>

```js
Class Student {
  #name = 'No Name';

  get name() {
  return this.#name;
  }

  set name(newName) {
  this.#name = newName;
  }
}

const student = new Student();
console.log(student.name()); // No Name
console.log(student.#name); // Error
```

</CodeDivWrapper>

# Default values set

Now you can set the values without putting them in constructor

<CodeDivWrapper>

```js
Class Student {
  name = 'Default Name';
  // constructor() { this.name = 'Default Name'} not needed
}

const student = new Student();
console.log(student.name); // Default Name
```

</CodeDivWrapper>

# Heap dump

Now node generates a heap dump that can be used to tackle memory issues

# more improvement on Worker Threads

I have another blog on what can this worker threads do. THis one has now improved

# Async stack trace

Previously in case of async functions calling each other it was difficult to tell where the problem started. Because only the last async function was shown and rest were trimmed
you can see the full stack trace
