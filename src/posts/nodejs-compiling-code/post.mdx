Is nodejs a compiler of interpreter? Js is a scripting language so nodejs should be an interpreter right? But actually its a little complicated to answer like this.

# Compiler

- Reads the whole program and creates another version of the program that will be executed later.
- takes more time to execute because first it needs to create this machine readable "byte code" and then execute it.

# Intepreter

- Reads the program line by line and executes them.
- takes less time because executable thing is already ready
- This is what JS was used to be long time ago

# JS Engine

- converting js code to machine code some engine is required
- V8 for Chrome, Spidermonkey for firefox these are the engines that are used

# ECMA script

- Since all these engines are converting js to machine code there has to be some standard to be followed by all browsers.
- ECMA script is the standard for that
- WHenever the versioning of JS is asked its meant Version of ECMAScript (ES6/7)

# Nodejs structure

- A compiler: Turbo fan
- A interpreter: Igniter
- Igniter creates the bytecode that immediately starts running
- based on the data that is received on the running program, Turbo fan starts optimizing the machine code and the machine code is replaced in runtime
- One example of this smart machine code optimization is: how nodejs realizes the types of some param. When same type of input is passed it optimizes the code to always take that kind of input

# So is it a compiled or interpreted language?

- Its a Just in time (JIT) compiled language.
- C++ is a ahead of time(AOT) compiled language
- V8 creates some machine code before executing. Then while executing it creates more machine code and updates already existing machine codes
