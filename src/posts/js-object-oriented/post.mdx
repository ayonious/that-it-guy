Js is an OOP. But not classbased but rather prototype based language. What the hell does it actually mean?

# OOP

To be a language OOP it needs to have objects (in classical system by: classes). On top it should have properties:

1. Inheritance
2. Encapsulation
3. Polymorphism

But js creates this objects through prototypes.

# JS as OOP

you can definitely create objects. just like this

<CodeDivWrapper>

```js
const a = { name: "sam", age: 23 };
```

</CodeDivWrapper>

But then how do you create class kind of object definition in JS?

# Method1: By constuctor

constuctor is a function that you call with new operator.

<CodeDivWrapper>

```js
function Student(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Student.prototype.studentType = function () {
  return `${this.name} ${this.age}`;
};

Student.prototype.secondName = "some shit";

let firstguy = new Student("john", 22);
console.log(firstguy.studentType);
```

</CodeDivWrapper>

# Method2: Object.create

<CodeDivWrapper>

```js
const st1 = {
  name = 'John';
  age = 12;
}

const st2 = Object.create(st1);
// st2 will inherit properties from st1

```

</CodeDivWrapper>

# Detailed shit

Now every object in js inherits all the properties from its parent. When you create a function that creates this object this function actually creates a template object and every time you create a new object this template object provides all its properties.

- Any object can be cloned from another object. the clone will share same prps of its parents.

# So that means

When you do some thing like Student.prototype.studentType = function

This tells all the object to have an extra ref to that property.

# Method3: by classes ðŸ˜®

After saying all those shit about how js is not class based language now Im saying you can do classes in js. Well actually class in js is just a layer on top of prototype

I will write a new article on this about using classes in JS.
