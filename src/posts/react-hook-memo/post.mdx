import CodeDivWrapper from "../../components/CodeWrapper";

import { Link } from "gatsby";

In simple words this controls when to not re-render your component.

I got a situation recently where a Form component was re-rendering and this was causing some glich to a field that user had to interact.

# How React Re render using Props

React looks at all the values of the props and if its different than previous props then it re-render. Its easy and simple mechanism. But this comparison is a shallow comparison.
But if some props are object then React makes a shallow comparison for that.

In short: Which means if same props are passed as object React will always Re-render.

## How to stop react from re-rendering?

### In pure react class components

<CodeDivWrapper>

```js
shouldComponentUpdate(prevProps, nextProps) {
  if(prevProps.props1.someval === nextProps.props1.someval) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

</CodeDivWrapper>

### In functional react components

<CodeDivWrapper>

```js
import { memo } from 'react';

const isPropsEqual = (prevProps, nextProps) {
  if(prevProps.props1.someval === nextProps.props1.someval) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
};

const Component = (props) => {
  return <></>;
};

export default memo(Component, isPropsEqual);
```

</CodeDivWrapper>
