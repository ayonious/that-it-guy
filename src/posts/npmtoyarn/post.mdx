import CodeDivWrapper from "../../components/CodeWrapper";

We have started migrating from npm to yarn and the process was quite neat and clean.

## Steps

1. remove all package-lock.json

2. run yarn. yarn.lock file will be created

3. Thats all

Now its time to know the equivalent commands in yarn that you used in npm

<CodeDivWrapper>

```bash
npm install -> yarn
npm run [script] -> yarn run [script]
npm test -> yarn test
npm install [package] --save -> yarn add [package]
npm install [package] --save-dev -> yarn add [package] --dev
```

</CodeDivWrapper>
