import CodeDivWrapper from "../../components/CodeWrapper";

import { Link } from "gatsby";

Its called "Side Effects Hook". I started using it more and more and discovered some interesting nature of this.

# Why useEffect

Because previously the code in Class component would be like this

## Initialize something

Initialize some values from database to fill in some states.

But now thanks to hooks we can make the code as short as this.

<CodeDivWrapper>

```js
const ShowElements = () => {
  const [values, setValues] = useState([]);

  // this will make sure this will run only once after the component is
  useEffect(() => {
    const data = Database.fetchValues();
    setValues(data);
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      {values.map((val) => {
        <span>val</span>;
      })}
    </>
  );
};
```

</CodeDivWrapper>

useEffect(() => {}, []);
