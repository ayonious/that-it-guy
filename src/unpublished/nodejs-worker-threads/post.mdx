import CodeDivWrapper from "../../components/CodeWrapper";

Since Im exploring newest version features of all languages I thoguht why not also look at node and see what the heck are they doing in new versions.

## Private class fields

```js
Class Student {
  #name = 'No Name';

  get name() {
  return this.#name;
  }

  set name(newName) {
  this.#name = newName;
  }
}

const student = new Student();
console.log(student.name()); // No Name
console.log(student.#name); // Error
```

# Heap dump

Now node generates a heap dump that can be used to tackle memory issues
