import CodeDivWrapper from "../../components/CodeWrapper";

CSS is all about presentation. No matter what advanced components you are using every now and then you need to get your hands dirty. Its better to know about these for now. So here goes all the ways I know adding css in your js project.

# Global CSS

# inline CSS

<CodeDivWrapper>

```css
background: red;
```

</CodeDivWrapper>

# styled components

# SCSS

# css modules

It was such a relieve for my to finally have this command. No need to create class files and then run shit.
