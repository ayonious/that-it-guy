import { CodeDivWrapper } from "../../css/commonstyles";
import Highlight from "react-highlight.js";
import { Link } from "gatsby";

Context is a very simple thing. A global storage to save all common data. Then all the children uses those variables. What is helps is that you dont need to pass around common variables as props. There is another interesting application I found for react Context. Its changing the theme of your website. Let me describe the process here.

<CodeDivWrapper>

<Highlight>

```jsx
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react", "@babel/typescript"]
}
```

</Highlight>

</CodeDivWrapper>
