# Thread of nodejs

So nodejs is a single threaded application.

This only means there is one main thread and many other auxilary threads.

Now once a request comes in the main thread receives it and deligates the work of this to other threads.

For example the operation of getting a data from database is taken care of by some worker thread.

## Now why is single threading a good thing?

1. One reason is you need application level locking mechanism. And its not necessary at all.
